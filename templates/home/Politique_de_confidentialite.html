                <b>Privacy Policy</b>

                <p>FAN'COIFFURE website is owned by FAN'COIFFURE, which is a data controller of your personal data.</p>

                <p>We have adopted this Privacy Policy, which determines how we are processing the information collected by FAN'COIFFURE, which also provides the reasons why we must collect certain personal data about you. Therefore, you must read this Privacy
                    Policy before using FAN'COIFFURE website.</p>

                <p>We take care of your personal data and undertake to guarantee its confidentiality and security.</p>
                <b>Personal information we collect:</b>

                <p>When you visit the FAN'COIFFURE, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the installed cookies on your device. Additionally, as you
                    browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information
                    as “Device Information.” Moreover, we might collect the personal data you provide to us (including but not limited to Name, Surname, Address, payment information, etc.) during registration to be able to fulfill the agreement.</p>
                <b>Why do we process your data?</b>

                <p>Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the website. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential
                    cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that it would identify any particular user of the system.</p>

                <p>You can visit the website without telling us who you are or revealing any information, by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the website’s features, or you wish
                    to receive our newsletter or provide other details by filling a form, you may provide personal data to us, such as your email, first name, last name, city of residence, organization, telephone number. You can choose not to provide
                    us with your personal data, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the website’s features. For example, you won’t be able to receive our Newsletter or contact us directly from the website. Users who are uncertain
                    about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us via sebastien-1985@live.fr.</p>
